GL_DELETE_STATUS
params returns GL_TRUE if program is currently flagged for deletion, and GL_FALSE otherwise.

GL_LINK_STATUS
params returns GL_TRUE if the last link operation on program was successful, and GL_FALSE otherwise.

GL_VALIDATE_STATUS
params returns GL_TRUE or if the last validation operation on program was successful, and GL_FALSE otherwise.

GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH
params returns the number of characters in the information log for program including the null termination character (i.e., the size of the character buffer required to store the information log). If program has no information log, a value of 0 is returned.

GL_ATTACHED_SHADERS
params returns the number of shader objects attached to program.

GL_ACTIVE_ATTRIBUTES
params returns the number of active attribute variables for program.

GL_ACTIVE_ATTRIBUTE_MAX_LENGTH
params returns the length of the longest active attribute name for program, including the null termination character (i.e., the size of the character buffer required to store the longest attribute name). If no active attributes exist, 0 is returned.

GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORMS
params returns the number of active uniform variables for program.

GL_ACTIVE_UNIFORM_MAX_LENGTH
params returns the length of the longest active uniform variable name for program, including the null termination character (i.e., the size of the character buffer required to store the longest uniform variable name). If no active uniform variables exist, 0 is returned.

GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER_MODE
params returns a symbolic constant indicating the buffer mode used when transform feedback is active. This may be GL_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS or GL_INTERLEAVED_ATTRIBS.

GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYINGS
params returns the number of varying variables to capture in transform feedback mode for the program.

GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_VARYING_MAX_LENGTH
params returns the length of the longest variable name to be used for transform feedback, including the null-terminator.

GL_GEOMETRY_VERTICES_OUT
params returns the maximum number of vertices that the geometry shader in program will output.

GL_GEOMETRY_INPUT_TYPE
params returns a symbolic constant indicating the primitive type accepted as input to the geometry shader contained in program.

GL_GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_TYPE
params returns a symbolic constant indicating the primitive type that will be output by the geometry shader contained in program.
